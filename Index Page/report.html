      this is my website i have decided to go with a darker more modern theme and used shapes that move around for animation. this page i struggled with and had a different disign at first using yellows and other colours to make it. i decided to go with the darker colours because my text would pop and make it more visable. i have fully mastered div tags and how to use them with css which is amazing because that is what i struggles with at first
    </p>

<p>
  i used research on animations and ai on my shape animations on my video page however they didnt work which was a shame but i think the rest of them went alright i have other areas for those tho however and would like to formally add stuff as i go along with this web page.
    </p>

    <p>
      this is the first web page i have ever created and i do like how it has went i did need help with it however but i do have a penpal that helped me get it done i have also learnt the block method and have had fun jiggling around around with absolute positioning and pixels.
